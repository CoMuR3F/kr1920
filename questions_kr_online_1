    Would it be possible using the concatenated predicate to get any pair of consecutive numbers from a list? If so, How would you have to use the concatenated predicate to get it?

/*
pair(+list, -result)
the predicate is true, if the result 
conatins the elements of the list in 
pairs the right order.
*/

pair([], []).
pair(list, R):-
    [x|y] = list,
    [a|b] = y,
    pair(b, R2),
    append([[x, a]], R2, R).




    Is it possible to make a reversible use of the invert predicate? If not possible, could you justify why?

of couse, you can change to order of a list so oft you want.
You don't lose or create any elements, you only change the chronology of order, so it is reversible.

if you change [1,2] -> [2,1] and change again [2,1] -> [1,2] it is true.
for each bigger list it is similar, so it is true for all.




    It would be able to indicate which characteristic makes a predicate not reversible.

a predicate is everytime reversible, if the croweds of elements are bijective.
a predicate is one time reversible, if the croweds of elements are injective and not surjective.




    As we have seen in class, the reversible use of predicates is a very powerful feature of Prolog. Make use of a combination of the concatenate and invert predicates in which this technique is used.
